# Data Science in Production Project: Customer Bank Churn Prediction

## Project Description

Welcome to our Data Science project, where myself and 4 other EPITA students combine machine learning with advanced technologies to develop an application that predicts bank customer churn. Our solution integrates FastAPI, Streamlit, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow, and Grafana to offer a full-stack application capable of processing, analyzing, and predicting churn with real-time capabilities.
